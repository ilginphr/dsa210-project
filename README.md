**Analyzing the Impact of Caloric Intake, Burned Calories, and Water Consumption on Weight Loss**

### **Motivation**

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle requires a balanced approach to diet, exercise, and hydration. Weight management is not just about aesthetics but also about overall well-being and long-term health. This project aims to explore the impact of daily caloric intake, burned calories, and water consumption on weight loss. By understanding these relationships, individuals can make informed decisions to improve their health and achieve their fitness goals more efficiently.

### **Objectives**
- Investigate the correlation between caloric intake, burned calories, and weight loss.
- Analyze the effect of water consumption on weight loss.
- Identify optimal dietary and exercise patterns that contribute to sustainable weight loss.

### **Data Sources**
To conduct this analysis, data will be collected through the following methods:

- **Caloric Intake**: Logged using a nutrition tracking app (Yazio, Diyetkolik, MySu+).
- **Burned Calories**: Tracked using a fitness tracker (e.g., Apple Watch) or estimated using a caloric expenditure formula based on activity levels.
- **Water Consumption**: Recorded manually using a daily log and an app for reminders (Water Reminder).
- **Weight Data**: Measured daily or weekly using a digital scale.

### **Hypothesis Testing**
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant relationship between caloric intake, burned calories, water consumption, and weight loss.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant relationship between these factors and weight loss.

### **Expected Outcomes**
By the end of this study, the project aims to answer the following questions:
- Does maintaining a caloric deficit lead to consistent weight loss?
- What is the optimal water consumption level for effective weight management?
- Are there specific dietary and exercise habits that maximize weight loss efficiency?

### **Limitations & Future Work**
- The project relies on self-reported data, which may introduce measurement bias.
- External factors such as sleep, stress, and metabolism are not considered.
- Future work could include tracking macronutrient intake (protein, carbs, fats) for a more detailed analysis.

### **Conclusion**
This project will provide valuable insights into how dietary and exercise habits affect weight management. The findings can help individuals optimize their routines for better health outcomes. As data collection progresses, further improvements in methodology and analysis will be explored to refine results and enhance accuracy.

Findings:
- Personal data was collected daily, including weight, calorie intake, burned calories, and water consumption.

- The data was cleaned and enriched (e.g., calculated daily Caloric Deficit as a new feature).

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted through various visualizations.

- Hypothesis testing was performed using Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values to examine the relationship between weight and other variables.

Visualizations Used
The following plots were generated to support the analysis:

Line Plot:
-Weight Over Time

Scatter Plots:
-Caloric Intake vs Weight
(Daily calorie intake and its relationship to body weight were examined.)
-Burned Calories vs Weight
(Checked whether burned calories impact daily weight changes.)
-Water Consumption vs Weight
(Analyzed if hydration levels correspond to any weight variation.)
-Caloric Deficit vs Weight
(Investigated whether a larger deficit leads to lower weight.)

Dual Line Plot:
-Caloric Intake vs Burned Calories over Time
(Compared daily intake and calories burned to identify energy balance patterns.)

Histograms:
-Weight Distribution
(Visualized how frequently specific weight values occurred.)
-Caloric Intake Distribution
(Showed the spread of daily calorie intake levels.)
-Burned Calories Distribution
(Displayed how burned calories are distributed across days.)

Correlation Heatmap:
-Correlation Matrix showing relationships between all variables
(Evaluated statistical relationships between all variables (e.g., intake, deficit, weight).)
